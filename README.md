# Extended Substrate Cumulus Parachain Template

A new [Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/)-based Substrate node, ready for hacking ‚òÅÔ∏è..

This project is originally a fork of the [Substrate Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template) which in turn is a fork of 
[Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template),
modified to include dependencies required for registering this node as a **parathread** or
**parachain** to a **relay chain**.

This repository also comes with Ethereum compatibility layer built using [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier) and [Debug-Trace API from Moonbeam](https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam/). 

## Getting Started

### Rust Setup

First, complete the [basic Rust setup instructions](./docs/rust-setup.md).

### Build

Clone the extended template repository on either the `main` branch or the `frontier` branch: 

```sh
# Checkout the frontier branch and build the parachain
git checkout frontier 
```

Use the following command to build the node
without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Next you will need a compatible release of [Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) to run a testnet. You may also want to use [Zombienet (available for Linux and MacOS)](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases) for spinning up a testnet: 

```sh
wget https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/download/v1.3.30/zombienet-macos
chmod +x zombienet-macos 
cp zombienet-macos /usr/local/bin
```

You'll need to download the Zombienet executable.

You can find linux and macOS executables of the Zombienet CLI here:

https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases
Download the Zombienet CLI according to your operating system.

Tip: If you want the executable to be available system-wide then you can follow these steps (otherwise just download the executable to your working directory):
```sh
wget https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/download/v1.3.30/zombienet-macos
chmod +x zombienet-macos 
cp zombienet-macos /usr/local/bin
```
Make sure Zombienet CLI is installed correctly:
```sh
./zombienet-macos --help
```
You should see some similar output:
```sh
Usage: zombienet [options] [command]

Options:
  -c, --spawn-concurrency <concurrency>  Number of concurrent spawning process to launch, default is 1
  -p, --provider <provider>              Override provider to use (choices: "podman", "kubernetes", "native")
  -m, --monitor                          Start as monitor, do not auto cleanup network
  -h, --help                             display help for command

Commands:
  spawn <networkConfig> [creds]          Spawn the network defined in the config
  test <testFile> [runningNetworkSpec]   Run tests on the network defined
  setup <binaries...>                    Setup is meant for downloading and making dev environment of Zombienet ready
  version                                Prints zombienet version
  help [command]                         display help for command

```

### Setting up Zombienet config

You may use a reference implementation from the folder `zombienet-config` or make your own. More instructions here: [Simulate parachains in a test network
